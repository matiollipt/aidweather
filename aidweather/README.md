# AidWeather

**AidWeather** is a Python client for retrieving and visualizing NASA POWER daily weather data. It enables streamlined access to key agro-meteorological parameters with flexible filtering, aggregation, and plotting tools.

## Features

- üì° Fetch daily weather data directly from the NASA POWER API
- üìä Plot and overlay time series of weather and agrimetric data
- üîç Filter by date ranges and custom value thresholds
- üß† Built-in parameter descriptions for interpretability
- üó∫Ô∏è Interactive location mapping
- üé® Configurable visualization themes

## Getting Started

### Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aidweather.git
cd aidweather
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Modify `config.json` to adjust:

- Default weather parameters
- Colormaps and plot style
- NASA POWER base API URL

### Usage

```python
from aidweather.core import AidWeather
from aidweather.dataviz import Visualizer
from aidweather.config import cfg

client = AidWeather("MySite", lat=-10.5, lon=-55.3, start="2023-01-01", end="2023-12-31")
df = client.get(long_names=True)

viz = Visualizer("MySite", cfg["POWER_PARAM_DESCRIPTIONS"], client.get)
viz.plot(cols=["T2M", "PRECTOTCORR"], ma=7, dual=True)
```

## Example Output

- üìà Time-series plots with moving averages
- üå¶ Overlay plots for crop and weather data
- üîÅ Monthly aggregation with correlation analysis
